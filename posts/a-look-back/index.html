  <h1 id="preamble">Preamble</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s the end of the year, and as such I thought it might be a good idea to reflect on how the year went, and what, if any, personal progress I have made throughout the year. Let&rsquo;s start at the top.</p>
<h1 id="resolutions">Resolutions</h1>
<p>At the beginning of the year I made two resolutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was going to blog at least once a month &ndash; oops.</li>
<li>I was going to journal everyday &ndash; also oops, but I did do more journaling than I ever have before, so that&rsquo;s a win in my book.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think making New Year Resolutions puts an undue amount of stress on myself, which causes me to want to not do them as a &ldquo;screw you&rdquo; to past me. What does he know? I&rsquo;m older, wiser, and handsomer than he is. Phooey on him.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I think I&rsquo;m going to transition from resolutions to short term goals. Like, individual goals for each month. That way, I can focus on what is important to me, and am able to adjust as the year progresses to accommodate for shifting priorities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping that I can start blogging at least once a month to make future retrospectives easier on myself, but who knows what Future Eli is going to think of that.</p>
<h1 id="professional-life">Professional Life</h1>
<p>This year has been absolutely crazy professionally. I took over and then subsequently closed a business in Tennessee; led my team at the store to have another double-digit growth year; got a promotion at my other job; and somehow became a subject matter expert in the lab area I tend to work in. All of these things are great, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re asking yourself, &ldquo;Eli, when did you have any time for yourself?&rdquo; Well, dear reader, that&rsquo;s the secret, I largely did not. One of my goals for 2026 is to work on work-life-balance.</p>
<h1 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h1>
<p>As mentioned above, work-life-balance has not been much of a thing the last few years for me. I have found myself becoming more and more of a workaholic, and did not have much going on in my life outside of my professional processes and lifestyle. That changed about half way through the year when I met my new significant other.</p>
<p>Since May, I have been seeing someone, and things are going really really well. She is absolutely fantastic. She is caring, smart, funny, and she pushes me to get out of my comfort zone and do things I&rsquo;m not accustomed to doing (going on hikes and eating better, for example). We met in late May, and after a month or so of seeing each other casually, decided to make things official. She has been my main motivation to taking time away from the store, both for myself and for her, and I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a piece of my life back and can breathe easier. I&rsquo;m very hopeful for the future and looking forward to things to come.</p>
<h1 id="health">Health</h1>
<p>Overall, I have strived to be healthier in 2025. After losing time and being out after a brief stint in the hospital in late 2024 due to back issues, I have been going to the chiropractor and trying to do regular stretches at work to help strengthen my back and get myself adjusted properly. Both of these things seem to be working, as I&rsquo;ve gotten most of the feeling back in my left leg and foot, which has taken most of the year to accomplish.</p>
<p>I still need to work on eating better and losing weight, as I am just under the diabetic line, and I do not want to cross that barrier and have to deal with that. I think this is totally doable, I just need to buckle down and actually care about myself. Especially now that I have another person who assumedly wants me to stick around for a while.</p>
<h1 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h1>
<p>Gaming is still pretty big in my life, with the game store and all. I still play Magic and various RPGs multiple times a week (although, I&rsquo;m trying to give myself time to get that passion and fun back that has been a little lost). I got a Legion Go S to replace my desktop computer that died in 2022, and plan to play some games with friends back home more often to help with the work-life-balance thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten really into the every day carry (EDC) world this year, and have been on a search to find the perfect loadout for myself. This has resulted in purchasing several bags and backpacks, notebook systems, pens, knives, etc. While my bank account and wallet have not been super pleased with me, I think I am near a point where I have the system I need taken care of. I might do a future post covering what I carry with me in my various EDC capacities.</p>
<p>This year I have attempted to get back into reading! I used to love to do that, and would regularly read several dozen books in a year. While I&rsquo;m not at that level again, I have read more this year than last year. My original plan was to post about the books I read this year, but that didn&rsquo;t happen. Maybe 2026 will be the year of the book blog!!!</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Overall, I think 2025 was a pretty good year for me. There were things in the world that happened that were not good. Things in my personal life that were not good. And things that could have gone better. With that being said, I&rsquo;m hoping 2026 is better. Not just for me, but for everyone. The world needs more stability, love, kindness, and empathy, and I am going to strive to be that in my community.</p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone! Let&rsquo;s make 2026 amazing.</p>
